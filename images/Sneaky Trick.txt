Dear UMer

Thieves are plenty so DO ALSO protect your images folder with the index.html

It's also a sneaky "stealth" trick to effortless 
EARN $23.97 MONTHLY RECURRING COMMISSIONS
from UM Vault referrals :-)

1) Open images/index.html (even notepad will do) 

2) CHANGE the 2 times 3490 to your Aff ID #

3) SAVE

4) DELETE this txt file :-)

5) NOW you can upload the images folder sleeping WELL, 
knowing the images are safe from thieves 
& you'll get paid for referrals

Seeking YOUR Success,
